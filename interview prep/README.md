For each and any problem in either the DS or Algo directory, make sure to highlight concepts that are relevant to the problem at hand.

Concepts include:
- Bit Manipulation
- Memory (Stack vs Heap)
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Time and Space Complexity

# Time and Space Complexity
Be sure to leave comments in relevant parts of the code for each problem. This will help you engrain the concepts deeper and you will
recognize patterns the more problems you do.
